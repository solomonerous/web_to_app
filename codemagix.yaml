Here are the changes made:

1. Combined the `push` and `pull_request` events into a single `on` section to reduce duplication.
2. Added a `working-directory` parameter to the `build-and-deploy` job to specify the directory where the Flutter project is located.
3. Updated the `flutter pub get` step to use the `flutter` command instead of `dart`.
4. Added a new step to build the Flutter webview app and deploy it to GitHub Pages using the `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action` action.
5. Updated the `Build iOS IPA` step to use the `flutter build ios` command and set the `working-directory` parameter to the correct path.
6. Updated the `Build Android APK` step to use the `flutter build apk` command and set the `working-directory` parameter to the correct path.
7. Indented the `Deploy to App Store and Google Play` step correctly under the `build-and-deploy` job.

Please make sure to replace the placeholder values (`${{ secrets.IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE }}`, etc.) with your actual secret values in your GitHub repository settings.
